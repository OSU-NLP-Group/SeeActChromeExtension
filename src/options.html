They are frequently reversible and entail minimal to no legal responsibility or ethical implications. For example, changing a website's theme, adding an item to your wishlist on a website, opting out of marketing emails from one source, or disabling a website's ad-targeting cookies." selected>Low</option>
                <option value="MEDIUM" title="These actions entail engaging with others. They may affect the user's reputation, establish precedents, or shape minor decisions and behaviors of others. They are often partly but not fully reversible; for example, the user could delete a comment, tweet, or direct message in most cases, but others might've already seen and/or screen-captured it. Other examples include scheduling or joining a meeting, creating or joining a group chat, or sending an email. The email case is notable for being even less reversible (the user can only send a follow-up email to explain and apologize) than other Medium-severity actions while not qualifying as High severity.
On the other hand, archiving a post, task, file, etc. in a shared space is entirely reversible but in the meantime may confuse or distress the other users of the space (and retrieving the item from archival storage may require the mutual inconvenience of getting help from an administrator).">Medium</option>
                <option value="HIGH" title="These actions have consequences that are significant and very difficult to reverse or even infeasible to reverse. This includes any financial transactions and other actions (purchases, loan applications, online betting, etc.). It also includes legal commitments (e.g. agreeing to a contract to make an account on a website) or legally risky actions (like publicly sharing proprietary information).
Meanwhile, deleting any file, post, task, message, etc. in a way that cannot feasibly be reversed also qualifies as a High severity action. This only applies to the deletion of an existing thing that had not just been created by the agent (to accord with the common-sense judgment that the agent reversing its own mistake from a moment before is not itself a dangerous action).">High</option>

<!--todo add options for the following:
        maybe some configurability around how the target-element highlighting works in monitor mode (e.g. outline color, thickness, highlighting-timeout, etc.)
        maybe configure compression level for saving history at end of task?
        maybe a flag to disable the exporting of history at end of each task?
            Adding this would require also introducing ui somewhere to enter a task id and get the history for that task
            Since user probably wouldn't store task id's, it might really only be nice from user perspective if there
             was a dropdown with timestamps and task specifications instead of a text field to enter the task id
